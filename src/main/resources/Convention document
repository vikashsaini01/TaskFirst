##Standard for naming in spring, for this project.
# To keep everything in uniform naming 


1. All view names - All letters in small.

e.g. -   "login", "loginsuccess", "home", "addtask" etc

1.1 All view files html, jsp, js should also follow the above rule. i.e. every letter in small

e.g  - login.html, loginsuccess.html, home.html, addtask.jsp



2. All models passed to views should follow the variable naming convention. 
i.e. All instance, class, and class constants are in mixed case with a 
lowercase first letter. Internal words start with capital letters. 

so model names would be like. e.g.

model.addObject("loginUser", new LoginUser());
model.addObject("userDetails", userDetails);
